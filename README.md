## To-Do List Application: A Comprehensive README

**Introduction**

This project implements a comprehensive to-do list application featuring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, secure password change functionality, and a responsive design. It leverages:

* **PHP:** Server-side scripting language for handling user interactions and database operations.
* **AJAX:** Asynchronous JavaScript and XML for dynamic communication between the client and server.
* **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Web development technologies for building the user interface and interactivity.
* **MySQL Database (optional):** Stores and manages task data.

**Key Features:**

* **CRUD Operations:**
    * Create new tasks with descriptive titles and due dates.
    * View a list of all tasks in a user-friendly table.
    * Edit existing tasks to update their details.
    * Delete tasks to remove them from the list.
* **Secure Password Change with OTP:**
    * Users can initiate password change requests.
    * A One-Time Password (OTP) is sent via email for verification.
    * Upon entering the correct OTP, users can set a new password.
* **Google reCAPTCHA for Login:**
    * Integrates Google reCAPTCHA to enhance login security.
    * Prevents automated login attempts by bots or malicious actors.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Adjusts the layout and functionality to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles).
    * Ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.

**Installation and Setup (if using MySQL):**

1. **Download and install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).**
2. **Install and configure a MySQL database server.**
3. **Create a database and user for the application.**
4. **Import the provided SQL file (if any) to set up the database schema.**
5. **Place the application files in the web server's document root directory.**
6. **Configure database connection details in `connection.php`.**
7. **Obtain Google reCAPTCHA API keys and integrate them into the login form.**
